Sorry for the multiple exclamation marks but IntelliJ 11 ust deleted all my projects. In fact, it even deleted all the prjects that were not open in IntelliJ!!!
Could someone please tell me how I can recover those files ? Or am I to assume they are all gone!
How did this happen ? I am not sure but the last time I saw my code was when I opened IntelliJ and it opened the projects that were previously open. It began to index one of them but I did not need that project open and I closed it. IntelliJ became unresponsive and I closed all the projects. I try to open them again and there is nothing!!!  Including the ones which were not even open in IntelliJ!!!   There is a major bug in IntelliJ and I am paying a heavy price for it now!
Thanks for replying.
I am 101% sure I did not explicitly delete the sources!
And how does it explain IntelliJ deleting all the other IntelliJ projects which were not even open at that time ?

I had over 40 projects (some can be recovered and some cannot!) and all of them...ALL OF THEM...wiped clean!

In the 5 years I have been using IntellI, this sort of a thing has never happened. This leads me to believe there is a serious bug in IntelliJ 11

And there is no question of recovering from local history because there are no local files any more. All of them are deleted!
